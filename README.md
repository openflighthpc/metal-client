### Update a record with the same file

When a record is updated with the same file content, the `payload` is not sent with the request. This triggers an error condition on the server resulting in error along these lines. This is a known bug which will be fixed in future implementations of the server.

```
> metal kickstart update foo /tmp/test 
metal: The payload attribute is required with this request
